First website that I am coding on GitHub (When finished on my server, will post there)
This website is to have diffrent catagories (computer, mental health, cats, etc) and will have directories and user submitted items in which an admin or moderator will incorpate into the sections user request them in. If you wish to submit an idea feel free to submit an pull request.
